# Car Service Scheduler

## Project Summary

The main purpose of this project is to facilitate scheduling car service appointments with a service provider. There are two main problems being addressed with this project. The first problem is customers knowing when appointments are available. The second problem is the need for a more hands-off approach for scheduling appointments but, still retaining manual operations if necessary. The main value for customers is that they donâ€™t have to call, they can see on the app and schedule from there. The main value for the service provider is being able to continue to work on other tasks (I.E. servicing appointments and or handling walk-in appointments) while more appointments are being set.
